## localcompose

**localcompose** is a community-driven toolset for running local Docker Compose apps in an offline-friendly, no-cloud-required way.  
It helps you stop juggling ports and IPs like `127.0.0.1:9000`, giving each app a clean domain name and a trusted HTTPS link.  
With minimal setup, your local tools feel like real websites â€” easier to browse, test, and connect across your system.

For example, you can turn `http://localhost:9000/` into `https://portainer.locom.self` â€” no cloud, no port hassle, just localhost done right.

ðŸ”§ Current focus:  
We are actively developing `locom`, a command-line tool to orchestrate local-only Docker Compose workflows with simplicity and clarity.

ðŸ’¡ Vision:  
Support developers, testers, and tinkerers who prefer local, private, and reliable environments â€” without unnecessary cloud complexity. See [strategic pyramid](../docs/strategic-pyramid.md) for visualization.
